This is my final project in HTML & CSS course.

PROBLEM STATEMENT: #pick any website recreate their Homepage
                   Using HTML, CSS and public-domain images, recreate their homepage from scratch. Write all the HTML and the CSS yourself. (Please do not copy any of the source                      from that site). If the page has images, you can use any images you find around the web (they don't have to match the originals exactly). Once you're done, your                    page should look as close to the original homepage as possible.
